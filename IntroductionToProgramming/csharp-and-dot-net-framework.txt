C# is a strong Object Oriented programming language that is mostly built on the .NET framework.

.NET is an application development framework - it contains numerous libraries containing a range of functionality.
.NET isn't just a library, but also a runtime for executing applications.The knowledge of C# implies some knowledge 
of .NET (because the C# object model corresponds to the .NET object model and you can do anything interesting in C# just 
by using .NET libraries).
